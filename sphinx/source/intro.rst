Why CherryPy?
#############

CherryPy is among the oldest web framework available for Python, yet many people aren't aware of its existence. 
One of the reason for this is that CherryPy is not a complete stack with built-in support for a multi-tier architecture.
It doesn't provide frontend utilities nor will it tell you how to speak with your storage. Instead, CherryPy's take
is to let the developer make those decisions. This is a contrasting position compared to other well-known frameworks. 

CherryPy has a clean interface and does its best to stay out of your way whilst providing
a reliable scaffolding for you to build from.

Typical use-cases for CherryPy go from regular web application with user frontends 
(think blogging, CMS, portals, ecommerce) to web-services only.
